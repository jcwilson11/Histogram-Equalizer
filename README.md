# **Histogram Equalization Project**

## **Repository Overview**
This repository hosts all materials related to my Histogram Equalization project, which was created as part of my Introducton to Image Processing and Coding course at Stevens Institute of Technology. The project involved creating a software tool for enhancing image contrast using histogram equalization techniques, developed in Visual Studio and MATLAB.

## **About the Creator: Joris Wilson**
- **Background**: 3rd-year Computer Engineering undergrad at Stevens Institute of Technology.
- **Interests**: Keen on digital image processing and coding.
- **Experience**: Developed skills in image analysis and software development through academic projects.

### **Skills**
- **Skill 1**: Proficient in C++, OpenCV, MATLAB, and Visual Studio.
- **Skill 2**: Experienced with image processing and data visualization.
- **Skill 3**: Capable of integrating different software tools for comprehensive project development.

---

## **Project Completion and Tools Used**
- Successfully developed a histogram equalization tool in C++ using OpenCV, integrated into Visual Studio for efficient coding and MATLAB for data visualization.
- Applied the tool to various images, observing significant improvements in image quality and contrast.

---

## **Setting Up the Project**
To run the histogram equalization code:
1. **Visual Studio Code Setup**: 
   - Ensure C++ and OpenCV are installed and configured.
   - Clone the repository and open the project in Visual Studio Code.
   - Build the project using the provided build configurations.

2. **MATLAB Setup**:
   - Install MATLAB and ensure it's configured to run scripts.
   - Use MATLAB to run the scripts provided in the repository for visualizing histograms and image data.

## **Execution and File Management**

After building the project in Visual Studio, execute the compiled `.exe` file within the directory containing the executable and your image files. Use Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt for this task. Here's an example command to run the histogram equalization:
```
& " .\Joris Wilson F23 CPE462 Final Project.exe" test2.png test2output 512 512 
```

This will process `test2.png` and generate `test2output_equalized.png` along with the `.csv` files for the histograms in the same directory.

### **Viewing Results in MATLAB**
To visualize the enhanced images and histograms in MATLAB, ensure the file names in the MATLAB script match those generated by the executable. For example:

```
% Define file paths
originalImageFile = 'test2.png';
equalizedImageFile = 'test2output_equalized.png';
originalHistogramFile = 'test2output_original_histogram.csv';
equalizedHistogramFile = 'test2output_equalized_histogram.csv';
```
