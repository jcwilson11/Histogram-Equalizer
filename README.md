# **Histogram Equalization Project**

## **Repository Overview**
This repository hosts all materials related to my Histogram Equalization project, which was created as part of my Introducton to Image Processing and Coding course at Stevens Institute of Technology. The project involved creating a software tool for enhancing image contrast using histogram equalization techniques, developed in Visual Studio and MATLAB.

## **Setting Up the Project**
To run the histogram equalization code:
1. **Visual Studio Code Setup**: 
   - Ensure C++ and OpenCV are installed and configured.
   - Clone the repository and open the project in Visual Studio Code.
   - Build the project using the provided build configurations.

2. **MATLAB Setup**:
   - Install MATLAB and ensure it's configured to run scripts.
   - Use MATLAB to run the scripts provided in the repository for visualizing histograms and image data.

## **Execution and File Management**

After building the project in Visual Studio, execute the compiled `.exe` file within the directory containing the executable and your image files. Use Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt for this task. Here's an example command to run the histogram equalization:


This will process `inputImage.png` and generate `outputImage.png` along with the `.csv` files for the histograms in the same directory.

### **Viewing Results in MATLAB**
To visualize the enhanced images and histograms in MATLAB, ensure the file names in the MATLAB script match those generated by the executable. For example:

matlab
Define file paths
originalImageFile = 'inputImage.png';
equalizedImageFile = 'outputImage_equalized.png';
originalHistogramFile = 'inputImage_original_histogram.csv';
equalizedHistogramFile = 'inputImage_equalized_histogram.csv';
